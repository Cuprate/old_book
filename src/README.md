# Cuprate Documentation  

## About 

[Cuprate](github.com/Cuprate/cuprate) is an independent Monero node written from
the ground up in Rust. It's goal is to be an alternative to the only other existent Monero node, monerod, written in C/C++. We believe that Cuprate will help to secure the Monero network by acting as a "safety net" if a critical vulnerability had to be found in monerod.

Moreover, Cuprate also try to bring numerous improvements over the original implementations. You can find more details at the [Cuprate](github.com/Cuprate/cuprate) repository page.

This book, curently under construction, will contain developers documentation for Cuprate and
also general Monero documenation. As the original node lack of clarity in some its implementations,
we hope that this book will also serve people familiar with monerod codebase to easily migrate to cuprate's one
The two documentations are made to be read together. If you believe that there is an error somewhere or something
seems difficult to understand, please let us know in the issues section

## Support

If you know how to code but don't know where to start please look at open 
[issues](https://github.com/Cuprate/cuprate/issues) and join our 
[revolt server](https://rvlt.gg/DZtCpfW1) we would really appreciate any help we can get.

If you don't know how to code you could support us by sending Monero to this address, the funds 
sent to this address will be used for **FUTURE** development only:
